Transitive Closure Computation


Reading an oriented graph represented by pairs of nodes and computing its transitive closure matrix. 
Displaying Adjacency Matrix of the given input and its transitive closure Matrix as output 

Input : 
- number of graph nodes 
- node value pairs for each node 

Output : 
- Adjacency Matrix 
- Transitive Closure Matrix 

Sample Input 

Number of graph nodes : 6 
pair1 : 1 2
pair2 : 2 3
pair3 : 3 1
pair4 : 4 5 
pair5 : 5 6 
pair6 : 6 4

output: 
Adjacency Matrix : 
[[0 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0]]
Transitive closure : 
[[1 1 1 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 0 0 0]
 [1 1 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 1 1]
 [0 0 0 1 1 1]
 [0 0 0 1 1 1]]
